<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Waffles are a delicious breakfast treat that can be enjoyed with a variety of toppings such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or chocolate sauce. To make waffles, start by preheating your waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 tablespoon of baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. In a separate bowl, beat 2 eggs until light and fluffy, then stir in 1 3/4 cups of milk, 1/2 cup of vegetable oil, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.</p>
Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix the batter, as this can result in tough waffles. Pour the batter onto the preheated waffle iron and cook according to the manufacturer's instructions until golden brown and crispy.</p>
<p>Once the waffles are cooked, serve them hot with your favorite toppings and enjoy a delicious and satisfying breakfast!</p>
