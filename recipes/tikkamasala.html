<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chicken Tikka Masala is a classic Indian dish that is rich, creamy, and packed with flavor. To make this dish, start by marinating 500 grams of chicken breast in a mixture of yogurt, lemon juice, and a blend of spices such as garam masala, cumin, and paprika. Let the chicken marinate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to develop.</p>
<p>Once the chicken is marinated, grill or bake it until it is cooked through and has a nice charred exterior. In a separate pan, saut√© a finely chopped onion, garlic, and ginger until fragrant and softened. Add a can of diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and a blend of spices such as garam masala, cumin, and paprika to create a rich and flavorful sauce.</p>
Once the sauce has thickened, add the cooked chicken to the pan and simmer until the flavors meld together. Finish the dish by stirring in a cup of heavy cream to create a luscious and creamy sauce. Serve the Chicken Tikka Masala over steamed rice or with a side of naan bread for a delicious and satisfying meal.</p>
